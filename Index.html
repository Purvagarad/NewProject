        <td><p>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
            The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>

        <td><p>The ensemble of mosques, minars, and other structures in the Qutb Minar complex is an outstanding testimony to the architectural and artistic achievements of Islamic rulers after they first established their power in the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century. The complex, located at the southern fringe of New Delhi, illustrates the new rulers’ aspiration to transform India from Dar-al-Harb to Dar-al-Islam with the introduction of distinctive building types and forms.
            Referred to as the Qutb mosque, the Quwwatu’l-Islam, meaning the Might of Islam, introduced to India the classic model of Islamic architecture that had developed in western Asia. The mosque constituted a large rectangular courtyard enclosed by arcades having carved pillars on three sides and an imposing five-arched screen marking the west. Incorporating temple elements such as the carved pillars and cladding characteristic of Hindu and Jain temples, it was completed by subsequent rulers – Qutb ud din Aibak and Shamsu’d-Din Iltutmish. Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, they constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam between 1199 and 1503, thereby completing the vocabulary of a typical classic Islamic mosque. Built of red and buff sandstone and eloquently carved with inscriptional bands, the Qutb Minar is the tallest masonry tower in India, measuring 72.5 metres high, with projecting balconies for calling all Muadhdhin to prayer.</p>

            India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial War Graves Commission (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The architect was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of New Delhi. The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria. Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known, continued until 1931, the year of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India.</p>

            Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.  It served to allow entry and access to India.
            The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city’s top tourist attraction.</p>

        <td><p>The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”.
            The main purpose behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the royal family and the court to observe the busy streets of the Johari Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been built without a foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for centuries.
            The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building resembles the crown of Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal architectural styles. The Rajput style can be seen in the domes canopies and the fluted pillars, while the stone inlay filigree work and the arches are perfect depictions of the Mughal style of architecture.</p>

The Ajanta Caves are mostly Buddhist sites and were used as a retreat by Buddhist Monks. Ellora has a better mix of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist sites. Both are an important UNESCO World Heritage site. The invaluable ensemble of 34 caves at Ellora in the Charanandri hills of western India’s Maharashtra State showcases a spirit of co-existence and religious tolerance through the outstanding architectural activities carried out by the followers of three prominent religions: Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism. The rock-cut activity was carried out in three phases from the 6th century to the 12th century. The earliest caves (caves 1–12), excavated between the 5th and 8th centuries, reflect the Mahayana philosophy of Buddhism then prevalent in this region. The Brahmanical group of caves (caves 13–29), including the renowned Kailasa temple (cave 16), was excavated between the 7th and 10th centuries. The last phase, between the 9th and 12th centuries, saw the excavation of a group of caves (caves 30–34) reflecting Jaina philosophy.</p>

Today, the memorial has been turned into a museum that has 25 galleries. It also houses paintings from the British Raj, along with memorabilia and manuscripts. There are paintings of the queen and Prince Albert in the Royal Gallery, along with artworks depicting events from the queen’s life.

A 16-foot-tall bronze statue – the figure of the Angel of Victory - stands atop the grand building – on the central dome. It is mounted on ball bearings and revolves with the wind.
